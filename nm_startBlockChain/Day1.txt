TypeScript has protection it works because of type inference.

#2.1 Implicit Types vs Explicit Types

This chapter is about Type System of TypeScript
TS combines two type of approaches
1. explicitly define what is the type of variable on data
2. just make like JS(TS infer)

First is we make TS infer alone.
like
let a = "hello"

Last is become a little bit more specific and explicit
like
let b : boolean = false

= first is better way
